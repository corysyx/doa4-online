# Changelog

## 0.3.2 (2026-11-11)

### Fixed
- The F7 FPS counter no longer makes the game send extra frames to the screen. With F7 on, the game showed each frame
  about 3 to 4 times (about 225 presents a second on a 144-164 Hz monitor), so other FPS overlays read 120-138 fps while
  F7 read 60, and motion could look uneven. Now every frame sent to the screen is a new one: 60 a second.
- Much lower CPU use, so the CPU runs cooler. Two of the game's threads (the file loader and the main thread's wait for
  the graphics) kept a CPU core each busy at 100% the whole time, even on the title screen. They now sleep while they wait.

### CPU use, measured (same scripted fight, same PC)
- Offline fight: about 2.7 CPU cores busy before, about 0.9 after (about a third).
- Online match (host): 1.8-2.4 cores before, about 0.7 after.
- The two threads that held a full core each now use almost none.
- Temperatures were not measured; the drop in CPU use is what lowers them.

### Unchanged (checked)
- Gameplay: the same fight recorded with the change off and on gives identical game state on every one of its 6995
  frames, and online matches stay in sync.
- Input lag: pad read to the frame handed to Windows, offline 20.5 ms before and after (online test 11.2 -> 10.9 ms).
- Frame rate and loading times.

### Notes
- If the new CPU behaviour ever causes trouble, add the line `doa4_idle_waits = false` to `dead_or_alive_4.toml`
  (in the game's folder) to go back to the old behaviour.

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-11)

### New
- Language and subtitles are saved, with a dropdown in the Esc menu's Game tab.
- Exclusive fullscreen (experimental), a VSync option (off by default), and customizable video output size.
- Shorter input lag (offline about 33 -> 20 ms).
- "Update available" notice on the title screen.
- The boot intro can be skipped.

### Fixed
- The white box behind PRESS START.

### Notes
- The first start after updating rebuilds the shader cache, so it is slower once.
